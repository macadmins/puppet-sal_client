# puppet-sal_client

Configuration of a Sal client using Puppet.

## Usage

```yaml
# The url of your server (required)
sal_client::server: https://sal.company.com
# The client's key (required)
sal_client::key: abc123
# the version you're deploying
sal_client::macos_version: "2.1.0"
# Facts that shouldn't be sent to the server
sal_client::skip_facts:
  - "some_fact"
  - "some_other_fact"
# Whether the client will sync the client side scripts directly from the server or if they will be deployed manually
sal_client::sync_scripts: true
# Use basic auth (please don't turn this off!)
sal_client::basic_auth: true
# Organisation name displayed in the profile. Cosmetic.
sal_client::payload_organization: "Sal Opensource"
# Control whether to submit Puppet state when using puppet_checkin_module
sal_client::report_puppet_state: false
```

### Optional Usage (Windows)

If you're installing the windows client for sal (gosal) you'll need to create a yaml representation of gosal's config file in Hiera. Here, the `management` key is optional if you want to send Facter data to sal.

```yaml
sal_client::gosal_config:
  management:
    tool: puppet # tells gosal which config management tool you're using
    path: C:\Program Files\Puppet Labs\Puppet\bin\puppet.bat # tells gosal where the path to said tool is
    command: facts # the command used as an argument to the path/tool
```

## Requirements

- [stdlib](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib)
- [client_stdlib](https://github.com/macadmins/puppet-client_stdlib)
- [mac_profiles_handler](https://github.com/keeleysam/puppet-mac_profiles_handler)

### Optional Usage (Debian)

If you're installing the Debian client for Sal (gosal) you'll need to create a yaml representation of gosal's config file in Hiera. Here, the `management` key is optional if you want to send Facter data to Sal.
